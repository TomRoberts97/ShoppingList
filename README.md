# ShoppingList
 Xamarin.Forms Moblie application, an E-Shopping List!

A user can create a shopping list by searching for items or adding each item manually.

A user can also search for Meals when adding items, if a Meal is chosen then all the items needed to make the meal are added to the shopping list.
Making shopping list much faster to make once the users meals have been added into the applcation.

To create a weekly shopping list a user would need to choose 7 breakfast meals, 7 lunch meals, 7 dinner meals (example of standard meal structure).
This would add all the items needed into the shopping list.
